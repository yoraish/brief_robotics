    "# Optical Flow for Odometry Estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our robots move in the real world! It is truly amazing!\n",
    "As they move, it is important for them to know _how much_ they have moved. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a robot has a map of a house, and it knows that the kitchen is 10 meters away from it in the forward direction, then it could navigate there only by moving forward and stopping after 10 meters. It is truly that simple! If the robot can measure its own motion that is. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of motion is called **Ego-motion**, and the computation of the distance traversed is called **Odometry**. From the Greek words _Odos_ and _Metron_, which mean _route_ and _measure_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Odometry Estimation problem consists of two main steps; Finding **good patches** (feature extraction) to look for **correspondences** between sequential images and constructing the **optical flow field**.  As for the first, there are multiple approaches to solving this challenge, such as using the [Harris Corner Detector](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-harris-corner-detector-32a88850b3f6). Having these \"good\" patches (\"matchable\" points between frames) we can use various methods to construct the _optical flow field_ such as the **Lucas-Kanade method**. This tutorial will focus on the second step - _constructing the optical flow field_. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is optical flow? Suppose our camera moves with respect to the world, then a point in the world moves with respect to the camera. Consequently, the projection of the point in the image also changes. This movement in the image plane is called _Optical Flow_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some math!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We solve the 2D SLAM problem, meaning our _z_ coordinate is constant.  "

    "$$ u = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}, v = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest approaches to find the optical flow is to assume that the flow is constant over local patch. Thus, we can use _Lucas Kanade_ tracker! However, we must first find patches to use! For simplicity, we assume that every patch in the image is a good patch, but no worries - we will publish an additional tutorial on the various methods that can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's assume we have a good patch to track and define it as a $N \\times N$ array of pixels located in the center of the image. \n"
